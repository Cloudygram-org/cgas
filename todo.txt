Controllers:
    - [] Handle TTUnaithorizedException (in all controllers)
    - [] Generate better respose methods in case of statuses != 200

Wrapper:
    - [] Take a look at parser.py an check if anything still makes sense
      at the state of the project as of now.

Documentation?:
    - Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html
    - Start somewhere simple (controllers?)
